A note on Nature’s archive
Nature’s archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s launch in 1869;  it includes some images, articles and language that by twenty-first-century standards are offensive and harmful, including sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not represent Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to publish today. We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the scientific and historical record, and so should remain available for scholars now and in the future. Nature is committed to making the changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a publication that champions science for everyone.
The first issue of Nature was published on 4 November 1869. Many earlier publishing adventures in science
had failed dismally, but Nature’s eventual success grew out of the social and scientific conditions under 
which it was founded — driven by the vision of strong personalities, who forged ahead when the odds seemed 
against them. Nature, above all, has been a survivor. This it owes to Alexander Macmillan, who tolerated a 
loss-making venture for three decades; to Norman Lockyer, the first editor; and to a string of influential 
collaborators and contributors, including biologist Thomas Henry Huxley — one of the heavyweights of Victorian 
science and a staunch ally of Charles Darwin (he was known as ‘Darwin’s bulldog’).
Brothers Alexander and Daniel Macmillan founded their bookshop and publishing house in Cambridge, UK, in 1843. 
After Daniel’s death in 1857, Alexander opened a London branch at 23 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Macmillan’s 
headquarters were in Cambridge until 1863, when they moved to 16 Bedford Street in London. The academic standing of the Macmillans in Cambridge (their shop was at the heart of the university city) later helped Alexander to establish contacts with eminent men of science in London. He would host ‘tobacco parliaments’, at which science, art and hot topics of the day, such as Darwinism, would be discussed. This “talk, tobacco and tipple on Thursdays” group, as he described it, fostered friendships among the great scientific educators of the Victorian era, including Huxley and the physicist John Tyndall, who were eager to write for Macmillan. In 1859, Alexander launched Macmillan’s Magazine, the first shilling monthly in England, aiming to unify science, literature and the arts under one banner, with David Masson as the editor. Huxley’s article ‘Time & Life’ was published in the second issue.
